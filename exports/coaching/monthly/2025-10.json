    "overall_performance": "** 462\n- **Net P&L:** -$232.99 indicates a losing month despite a high win rate.\n- **Win Rate:** 75.5% is quite strong, suggesting good entry timing or strategy.\n- **Profit Factor:** At 0.99, this is below 1, indicating that losses outweigh profits, which is a concern.\n- **Average Win vs. Average Loss:** The average win of $14.56 is significantly smaller than the average loss of $-48.27. This imbalance contributes to the negative net P&L.",

    "psychological_insights": "** The high max drawdown may lead to emotional trading decisions. It\u2019s crucial to remain disciplined and stick to your trading plan even during losing streaks.\n- **Confidence Issues:** The disparity between the win rate and net P&L might lead to overconfidence in winning strategies, while ignoring critical failures in risk management.",
